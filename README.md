the breaker itself is located at `/lib/index.js`

a mock service has been created in `test/services`

`test/adapter.test.js` tests the `feathers-adapters` suite

`test/index.test.js` tests the basic circuit-breaker functionality

to run the test suite, call `npm run test`. this will run the entire suite, so comment out any tests you don't want run

basically everything else in the repo is leftover from the original repo template (feathers-opossum)
